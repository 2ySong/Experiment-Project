It is said that the true nature of being is veiled. The labor of words,
the expression of art,
the seemingly ceaseless buzz that is human thought all have in common the need to get at what really is so.

In some cases it can even be fatal,
if pleasure is one's truth and its attainment more important than life itself.
In other lives, though, the search for what is truthful gives life.
